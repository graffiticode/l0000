// View is the SHARED, inherited front-end harness. It manages form state, drives
// compile/getData, reads its inputs from the URL search params, and posts state to the host
// via window.parent.postMessage — so it works both embedded in an iframe and standalone. It
// is parameterized by the language-specific `Form`: child languages import this `View` and
// inject their own `Form` (the only language-specific UX). L0000 ships the base `Form` (JSON),
// so its own embed mounts `<View Form={Form} />`.
//
// Compile/getData responses use the envelope `{ data, errors }`: successful output in `data`,
// compile errors in `errors`. The View stores `data` as the form's data model (so recompiles
// operate on real data, not the envelope) and threads `errors` to the Form alongside it.
//
// ── State ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The data model lives in React state and every `apply` re-renders. It used to live in an
// EXTERNAL mutable store (`createState`) that React did not track, which meant a form seeded
// from the `?data=` search param never appeared at all: the seed mutated the store from an
// effect, nothing re-rendered, and the harness kept showing the empty `<div/>` it had already
// committed. Keep state here, and keep the reducer PURE — it is re-run under StrictMode.
//
// ── The action protocol ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `init`      replace the model (a fresh load)
// `compiled`  MERGE the compile result over the model. It must not replace: a compile response
//             carries only what the compiler produced, so replacing discards client-side state
//             (focus, in-progress entries) and re-initializes the whole form on every edit.
// `update`    a user edit; merges, and requests a recompile
// `response`  a learner's answer; merges, and requests a recompile
// `focus`     selection tracking; merges under `focus` and does NOT recompile
//
// `loaded`   the stored model arriving from getData. Merges exactly like `compiled`; it is a
//            separate type only so the harness can tell an EXTERNAL load from the echo of an
//            edit the Form itself just reported (see `formModel` below).
//
// `response` and `focus` were previously unhandled, so they fell to the `default:` branch and
// returned the model UNCHANGED — silently discarding every answer a learner typed into an
// L0166/L0179 spreadsheet and every response an L0175 item collected.
//
// ── formModel: which model the Form is rendered from ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A CONTROLLED Form (the default, `formModel: "live"`) renders whatever the model currently
// says, so it must see every change — including its own edits coming back.
//
// An UNCONTROLLED Form owns its own editing state and only SEEDS from the model. L0166's
// spreadsheet Form — which L0179 injects — is one: its TableEditor builds a ProseMirror
// document from `interaction.cells` and, whenever that object's IDENTITY changes, rebuilds the
// whole document and puts the caret back in A1. Feeding such a Form its own reported edits
// re-seeds it on every keystroke commit: the grid visibly redraws and the selection jumps.
//
// L0166 never hits this because its state lives in an untracked closure that re-renders
// nothing — the editor is seeded once and left alone. `formModel: "loaded"` makes that
// deliberate rather than accidental: the Form renders from the model as last loaded from
// OUTSIDE it (`init`, `loaded`), while `update`/`response` and the compile results they
// trigger keep updating the live model for postMessage, recompiles, and reporting.
//
// A language whose Form needs different semantics for one of these passes `reduce`. It is
// consulted FIRST and returns `undefined` for anything it does not claim, so a language adds
// cases without restating the generic ones. This exists because L0179 injects L0166's
// spreadsheet Form, whose `update` must merge cell text into `data.interaction.cells` rather
// than onto the top level — a shape that has no business being hardcoded here.
//
// ── score: checking is the host's, not the Form's ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An assessment language passes `score`, and the View shows a Check button under the Form.
// Pressing it shows the score and hands the Form `showValidationUI: true` until the learner
// next changes the model (an `update` or `response` that changes nothing does not count). That flag is the one Learnosity sets through cqt, so a Form draws
// feedback from it and nothing else, and never needs to know which host it is in. It is laid
// over what the Form sees only: it is not in the model, so it is never posted or compiled.
// Whether feedback also shows WITHOUT a check (instant feedback) is the program's to say, and
// the Form reads that from the model itself.
